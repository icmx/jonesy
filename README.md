# Jonesy

Jonesy is a poor man's feeds aggregator built on top of cURL, Python and shell. It works in the middle of user's reader application and original feed source which allows to synchronise feeds list between multiple devices and save original reder application experience.

One should consider that Jonesy is more of an idea than real software which is actually pretty crappy.

## Requirements

You need the following to use Jonesy:

  - Bash or other POSIX compatible shell
  - cURL more or less actual version
  - Python 3 with standard libraries (no external dependencies required)
  - Latest version of Jonesy, of course! You can grab it by git or manually.

You don't have to build something since Jonesy is just a couple of scripts â€” once obtained and configured, they're ready to go.
